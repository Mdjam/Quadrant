## Development

### Workflow

**Eslint** configuration is set up ti handle React and Typescript code formating. Code formating follows the [Javascript styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as well as the [React styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) from airbnb.
**Prettier** is also set up to work along with eslint.

**Testing Workflow** is handled with **vitest**. We also use **testing-library** to have some frontend testing commodities with React.
